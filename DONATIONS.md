#### GitHub Sponsors

GitHub is matching all user contributions made with GitHub Sponsors for the first year.

GitHub is also covering all the transaction costs.

If you’re new to GitHub you may be presented with a “Your GitHub Sponsors contribution will not be matched at this time” warning.

This may be because you have a new GitHub account and/or are using a non-Paypal method of payment. From what I have read, this is temporary until GitHub verifies the payment method. Once verified, the contributions made will/should be matched.
